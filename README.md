2D game engine for Windows Visual Studio. 

Implementation is in C#. This is really bare-bones, but enough to demonstrate how accessible 2D-based game implementation is with Windows and Visual Studio.

This is about an afternoon's worth of work a few years ago. It's amateurishly implemented, but then again I coded this nearly a decade ago.
